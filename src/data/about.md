# Intro

I am a co-founder and the CEO of [Finstarts LTD](https://finstarts.by) where I build tools to price fine art quickly, accurately, and at scale. I also advise startups, and I invest in people and ideas through a [small venture fund](https://skepticalinvestments.biz). I am particularly interested in projects that touch health and safety, imaging, social impact, and aerospace. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.
